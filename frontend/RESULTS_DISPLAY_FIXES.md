# Results Display Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Metrics Display Not Working
**Problem:** The `MetricsDisplay` was looking for `result.metrics` and `result.sklearn_metrics`, but the actual data structure has:
- `result.your_implementation.metrics`
- `result.sklearn_implementation.metrics`

**Fix:** Updated `extractMetrics()` method to handle the correct nested structure:
```javascript
const yourMetrics = result.your_implementation?.metrics || result.metrics || {};
const sklearnMetrics = result.sklearn_implementation?.metrics || result.sklearn_metrics || {};
```

### 2. ✅ Charts Not Displaying
**Problem:** The `ChartManager` was looking for:
- `result.training_info?.loss_history` (should be `result.your_implementation.training_history`)
- `result.predictions` (should be `result.your_implementation.predictions`)
- `result.actual_values` (not present in the data structure)

**Fix:** Updated chart detection to handle correct data paths:
```javascript
const lossHistory = result.your_implementation?.training_history || 
                  result.training_info?.loss_history || 
                  result.loss_history;

const yourPredictions = result.your_implementation?.predictions || result.predictions;
const sklearnPredictions = result.sklearn_implementation?.predictions;
```

### 3. ✅ Added Classification Support
**Enhancement:** Added classification-specific chart for accuracy comparison:
- Bar chart showing accuracy comparison between implementations
- Proper handling of classification vs regression data
- Special visualization for binary classification results

## Data Structure Handled

Based on your logistic regression example:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  algorithm_id: 'logistic_regression',
  algorithm_type: 'binary_classification',
  your_implementation: {
    metrics: { accuracy: 0.6228, ... },
    predictions: [1,1,1,...],
    training_history: [12.83, 21.71, ...]
  },
  sklearn_implementation: {
    metrics: { accuracy: 0.9561, ... },
    predictions: [1,0,0,...]
  }
}
```

## Expected Results

Now the results display should show:
1. **Performance Comparison**: Accuracy metrics comparing your implementation (62.28%) vs sklearn (95.61%)
2. **Visualizations**: 
   - Training loss curve from `training_history`
   - Classification accuracy comparison bar chart
   - Predictions comparison scatter plot
3. **Training Details**: Algorithm info, hyperparameters, training time, etc.

## Testing

To verify the fixes are working:
1. Train a logistic regression model
2. Check that "Performance Comparison" shows accuracy metrics
3. Check that "Visualizations" shows training loss and accuracy charts
4. Verify no console errors about missing data

The fixes ensure compatibility with both the current data structure and potential future variations.
